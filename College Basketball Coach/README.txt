Description: A game where the player can play as the head coach of any 
NCAA Division I college basketball program, and simulate outcomes of games
using player attributes, and then recruit players based on team performance.

To run: Run the CBBSim.py file while keeping all other starter files in the 
same folder as CBBSim.py

like to start in. Then, click the name of the team in the conference that you
would like to be the head coach of. The game will then launch and further
