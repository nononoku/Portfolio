Noah Kuperberg's Portfolio
Updated 2/9/2022

About these files:
In this portfolio, you will find a collection of games coded in python that I
coded in my free time. The most extensive, and also one of my earliest 
projects is the College Basketball Coach game. 

Notable Absences:
The vast majority of code that I write right now is through my university, and 
as such cannot be publicly distributed, as releasing solutions to school 
projects is seen as a violation of the honor code, and could carry significant
consequences for me. I am willing to privately share my school code upon
request, if you would like to see my code for any of the topics listed below:
* C++ Code (Data Structures and Algorithms)
* Machine Learning Code
* Web Systems Code (back and front end)
* Computer Security Code
In addition to any specific code I have made reference to in my resume that is
not contained in my portfolio. E-mail me at noku@umich.edu with a Git Hub
account that I can share a private repository with, and which specific area you
are requesting to see more of, with the understanding that the private code is
not to be distributed under any circumstances.
